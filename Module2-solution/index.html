<h1>OUR MENU</h1>
<div class ="container">
<section class="boxb1 boxm1 boxs1"><p><span>CHICKEN</span>Place chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Place celery leaves in pot and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove chicken from pot and place in a bowl until cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, strain the cooking liquid, discard the celery tops and place the cooking liquid in a large pot. </p></section>

<section class="boxb2 boxm2 boxs2"><p> <span>BEEF</span> Beef is first divided into primal cuts, pieces of meat initially separated from the carcass during butchering. These are basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut. The term "primal cut" is quite different from "prime cut", used to characterize cuts considered to be of higher quality. </p></section>

<section  class="boxb3 boxm3 boxs3"><p><span>SUSHI</span> The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan (a notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by the Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry sell more fish in the early 1980s[30][31]). </p></section>
